            <p class="fundementals-text">Supporting your child in developing the necessary life skills to navigate their daily routine smoothly requires time. It's natural to feel frustrated and doubtful during this process, but it's important to be aware of the support provided by charities that can listen to you and guide you towards the assistance you might need to overcome challenging days. When considering the four fundamental areas, we concentrate on aspects that can be difficult to establish a routine for, particularly for children on the autism spectrum. Throughout this page, you will find recommendations and initiatives accompanied by real-life experiences related to each area.

              Please refrain from attempting anything if you're uncertain about its suitability for your child. Just because a certain approach works for someone else's child doesn't guarantee its success for your own. However, you can certainly learn from the experiences of others and adapt them into your child's routine if you feel comfortable doing so. Always consult your doctor for advice before implementing any changes that may contradict a health plan or seek reassurance regarding the proposed modifications.</p>

           <h2>Getting dressed</h2>
<p>Mastering the process of getting dressed is an essential aspect of daily life and a crucial life competency. Achieving success in this area relies on establishing a routine and maintaining consistency. While not all children with autism possess the ability to dress themselves, as a parent, you possess the knowledge to determine the appropriate time to support your child in acquiring this skill.

    Teaching my autistic son how to dress required significant amounts of time, practice, and patience. The process of donning clothes in the correct order, fastening buttons and zippers, and tying shoelaces encompasses the mastery of numerous abilities. When sensory triggers are added to the equation, it becomes evident why it took him longer to develop dressing skills compared to his peers of the same age.
    
    Nevertheless, the endeavor is well worth it. The ability to dress independently instills confidence in autistic children, enabling them to function autonomously at school, and alleviates one less concern for you during the mornings!</p>

<h2>school</h2>
<p>School can be an overwhelming experience for children with Autism. Transitioning from their familiar environment to a shared space can be challenging for them. If your child shows reluctance to go to school, it's crucial to address it early on. Here are some strategies you can try at home:

    Encourage open communication with your child about the issue. Visual supports can be helpful. Ask your child to rate events or places at school on a scale from "not scary" to "very scary." This can help you identify when and where the problems occur and build your child's resilience.
    If you understand the reasons behind their reluctance, communicate them to the school staff.
    Create a "worry book" for your child to document their anxieties during the school day. If appropriate, read the book together as part of their evening routine. This allows you to help them address any worries and suggest coping strategies for the future.
    Explore strategies to regulate, reduce, and monitor emotions and stress, such as incorporating exercise or using visual stress scales like a stress thermometer or traffic light system.
    Recognize and praise any progress your child makes on specific tasks, such as completing challenging assignments, wearing their school uniform, or walking past the school.
    Establish structure at home by using visual supports.
    Assist your child in developing their social skills.
    Help them understand the benefits of education and its importance.
    By implementing these strategies, you can support your child in navigating the challenges of school and promote their overall well-being.

    <h2>sleep</h2>
    <p>Sleeping can be a delicate process for a child with Autism. Each child is unique, and sleep patterns are no exception. Various factors, such as the environment, difficulty relaxing, melatonin imbalances, and more, can impact the sleep of an Autistic child. Finding a solution to improve sleep can often be a challenging and frustrating endeavor.

        Sleep deprivation not only affects the mood and energy levels of the child but also has an impact on everyone in the household. From being repeatedly awakened during the night to managing the mood swings of the Autistic child, the effects of inadequate sleep can be felt by the entire family.</p>
<h2>Eating</h2>
<p>Incorporate structure and routine into mealtimes. Children with autism benefit from a predictable eating schedule, including three regular meals and two snacks each day. While water can be offered between meals, it's important to limit other foods and drinks outside of the scheduled eating times.

    Continue to introduce less-preferred foods during meals. Removing these foods entirely prevents your child from having the opportunity to try new foods. Instead, consider including small amounts of new or nonpreferred foods, like a single green pea or half of a grape, on a separate plate. By offering smaller portions, you increase the likelihood of your child trying the food. If your child is still experiencing feeding difficulties, you can find more information about our Feeding Program. By following these tips, you can create a structured environment that encourages your child to explore new foods and expand their dietary choices.
