<p>Supporting children with complex needs like Autism can be challenging in everyday life. Finding relevant advice and increasing your understanding can be overwhelming, as you navigate through various forums and medical websites. Sometimes, the best support comes from learning from the experiences of other families and adapting their approaches to better suit your child. As a parent, you possess valuable insights into your child's needs, especially when it comes to identifying triggers and managing meltdowns.
  <br>
  <br>
  At Support with Autism, we strive to bring you authentic real-life experiences from people and families worldwide. We share information about new technologies and initiatives designed to support your child's growth, while also providing guidance on where to access these resources. Our dedicated team aims to provide you with a live feed of experiences in supporting children with Autism. We focus on four key areas crucial to your child's daily routine: getting dressed, eating, going to school, and going to sleep. Each of these areas presents its own set of challenges and obstacles.
