# Support Autism

[View here for Support Autism](https://nick8735.github.io/Autism-Project/)

Support Autism is a charitable website dedicated to providing assistance and resources for individuals facing the unique challenges of raising a child with autism. The website's "Real Life Experiences" section offers an invaluable platform for parents and caregivers to share their personal stories, highlighting both the obstacles they've encountered and the triumphs they've achieved. By featuring a diverse range of narratives in each of the four covered domains, readers gain access to multiple perspectives, ensuring a well-rounded understanding of the subject matter.

I selected this topic for my project because I noticed a significant gap in genuine support for parents dealing with autism. Existing autism support websites often overlook the true challenges and instead prioritize providing resources based on case studies, neglecting the valuable insights from parents and caregivers worldwide. Effective communication and collaboration among parents are essential for making informed decisions regarding our children's daily needs. I strongly believe that by sharing these stories and experiences, we can not only gather valuable support ideas but also encourage more open dialogue and inquiries, fostering continuous learning and support for our children with autism.


# Project Goals

Mission: Our aim is to establish a comprehensive platform that provides users with explicit support, offering key insights and ideas to assist them on their journey. We strive to create a space where parents can access the experiences and knowledge of other parents, enabling them to gain valuable wisdom and guidance.

# Design

### Colour Scheme

1. Three main colours used are white, grey and purple.

### Imagery

1. All images were selected from [Shutterstock](https://www.shutterstock.com). The Banner images were selected due to the bright colours and relating to Autism.

### Project design plan

Throughout the development process, my project underwent numerous transformations. Discovering the optimal design and flow for the website proved to be a challenge. As I progressed with the initial design, it became increasingly evident that the user experience lacked value and convenience.

<img src="asset/Images/readme-images/page-2.png" alt="page-2" style="width:150px;"/>

## How will I approach the design phase in the future?

<br>

* Prioritizing user experience is crucial, and an excessive number of pages can hinder users in finding their desired information.

* I intend to allocate more time to market research, as I found that drawing inspiration from other Autism charity websites greatly assisted me in selecting the appropriate design.

*  I will exercise greater caution when choosing imagery and ensure that I have a diverse range of backup images available in case any resolution issues arise later on.

* I will dedicate more consideration to how the code aligns with the design and its functionality, ensuring a cohesive and seamless integration. 

# Features

* Responsive on all device sizes.

* Interactive elements.

* User return appeal.

# Technologies Used

## Languages Used

* HTML5
* CSS3

## Frameworks, Libraries & Programs Used

1. Bootstrap 4.4.1
* Bootstrap was used to support only with the Nav Bar and Footer.
2. Git
* Git was used for version control by utilizing the Gitpod terminal to commit to Git and Push to GitHub. - In the future, I will exercise more discretion in utilizing commits and focus on providing more detailed commits that highlight significant code milestones.
3. GitHub
* Github was used to store project coding after being pushed.
4. Figma 
*  Figma was used to support with design and planning.
5. Shutterstock 
* Shutterstock was used to format images. 

# Testing

The W3C Markup Validator was used to validate every page of HTML code.

* Most errors were found on the support page as the examples shown below.

Main error was the use of the anchor as a descendant of the button element.

I found the answer on [Stack overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24837102/the-element-button-must-not-appear-as-a-descendant-of-the-a-element) which is a open forum for coding support.

Other errors were a range of unclosed divs.

### CSS

* The following shows CSS errors found at W3C Validator: 

Errors were for not using the correct values for 3 CSS elements.
