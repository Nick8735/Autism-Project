Support Autism is a charitable website dedicated to providing assistance and resources for individuals facing the unique challenges of raising a child with autism. The website's "Real Life Experiences" section offers an invaluable platform for parents and caregivers to share their personal stories, highlighting both the obstacles they've encountered and the triumphs they've achieved. By featuring a diverse range of narratives in each of the four covered domains, readers gain access to multiple perspectives, ensuring a well-rounded understanding of the subject matter.

I selected this topic for my project because I noticed a significant gap in genuine support for parents dealing with autism. Existing autism support websites often overlook the true challenges and instead prioritize providing resources based on case studies, neglecting the valuable insights from parents and caregivers worldwide. Effective communication and collaboration among parents are essential for making informed decisions regarding our children's daily needs. I strongly believe that by sharing these stories and experiences, we can not only gather valuable support ideas but also encourage more open dialogue and inquiries, fostering continuous learning and support for our children with autism.


# Project Goals

Mission: Our aim is to establish a comprehensive platform that provides users with explicit support, offering key insights and ideas to assist them on their journey.
